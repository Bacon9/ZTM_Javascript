// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.  


// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!

// 1 and 2:
var firstNumber = prompt ("What is your first number?");

// 3:
var secondNumber = prompt ("What is your second number?");

// 4:
var total = Number(firstNumber) + Number(secondNumber);
alert ("The total sum of your numbers is " + total + ".");

// Subtract:
var total = Number(firstNumber) - Number(secondNumber);
alert ("The total of your numbers subtracted is " + total + ".");

// Multiply:
var total = Number(firstNumber) * Number(secondNumber);
alert ("The total of your numbers multiplied is " + total + ".");

// Divide:
var total = Number(firstNumber) / Number(secondNumber);
alert ("The total of your numbers divided is " + total + ".");
